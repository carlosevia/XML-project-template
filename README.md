#XML Project
This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and XSLT templates for the XML assignment in Carlos Evia's *Creating User Documentation* ENGL 3814 at Virginia Tech in the fall 2013 semester.

##Overview
In Chapter 2 of TW101 (pages 40-46 to be precise), we read that technical writers frequently have to write content based on templates and structures. Sometimes, technical writers even have to develop the templates and structure definitions. For this assignment, however, the template and structure will be defined for us, just like it is oftentimes defined for technical writers by the company or the client. Your only concern will be creating good, task-oriented content that can be transformed effectively into a web-based format for the end user.

In this assignment you will author content for an online manual of your favorite gadgets. Your content will be coded in XML. You will write your code manually in Oxygen or another code editor and ensure that the code is valid. You should expect to write several hundred lines of code. That is ok; relax….but…. You should not wait until the last day to work on this project. Code takes a while to write. There will be a mandatory progress check along the way, and I am available in class and in office hours to help. Use me as a resource.

You are free to do research and find the gadget's original manual and some online tutorials. However, you are also encouraged to be original and even include your own lessons. The goal is to introduce a specific family member, friend, or significant other to your two favorite gadgets: your iPhone, Android, PS3, Vitamix, Dyson…. but in your own terms and tasks. Focus on the things you do with them and explain how the user could do the same things. 

##Instructions
Create an XML file with at least five "how to" modules for each of your two favorite gadgets. Simple tools like a shoe probably won't work, and you need something a little more complex.
Write brief introductory text for each section and include references for your sources.
Also, provide an “images” folder that contains unique and correctly-sized image file to be associated with your tasks.

We will work together in class to come up with a basic XML structure you should follow and requirements for syntax and images. We will also work on basic XSLT and CSS files, but you will need to customize them for your final product (no need to use fancy stuff like Bootstrap, but you are free to experiment)

We will work in class to create the basic structure and template for this project, but then you will need to customize yours in content and style.

##Deliverable Guidelines
Your final deliverable will be a .zip file that contains the following:
* One single XML file with your modules
* Several XSLT (and one CSS) files to transform the XML to HTML by filters such as gadget, audience or difficulty level
* Your “images” folder
* The HTML files resulting of your transformations

These deliverables should be turned in as a single .zip file via the Scholar assignment page by 11:55 p.m. on the due date.
